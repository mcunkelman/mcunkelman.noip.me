Total Time:
* Active:
* Inactive:
* Cooking: 18-22 Minutes
* Other:

Ingredients:
* 1.5 Cups All Purpose Flour (Bleached is fine)
* 1/2 Cups Sugar (I use a lite half cup)
* 1/2 Tsp. Salt
* 2 Tsp. Baking Powder
* 1/3 Cup Canola Oil
* 1 Egg
* 2/3 Cup Milk
* 1.5 Tsp. Vanilla Extract
* 8 - 12oz. Blueberries (Fresh are preferred, but frozen can be used or partially substituted)

Step 1: Start the batter by combining the following:
* 1.5 Cups All Purpose Flour
* 1/2 Cups Sugar
* 1/2 Tsp. Salt
* 2 Tsp. Baking Powder
Stir to mix

Step 2: In a 1 cup measuring cup combine the following
* 1/3 Cup Canola Oil
* 1 Egg
* 1.5 Tsp. Vanilla Extract
* Fill to 1 cup line with Milk (~2/3 Cup)
Whisk until completely blended

Step 3: Add the contents of the measuring cup to the dry ingredients
Stir thoroughly until the batter is free of clumps and is completely mixed

Step 4: Preheat oven to 400 degrees
I add my Lodge Cast Iron Muffin Tray to the oven while it preheats and set the rack to the middle of the oven

Step 5: Add blueberries to the batter
* 8 - 12oz Blueberries
Fold the blueberries into the better to mix them evenly without crushing them

Step 6: Grease the muffin tray
Once the oven and cast iron tray are fully heated, remove the tray from the oven and spray with cooking spray

Step 7: Add the batter to the muffin tray
For this recipe I try to evenly divide all of the batter between the 6 cups in one of my Lodge Cast Iron Muffin Trays

Bake for 18 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean


** Notes: Using mostly fresh blueberries with some frozen seems to work well **
