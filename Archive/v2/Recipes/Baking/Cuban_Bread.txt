Ingredients:
* 4 Cups Unbleached All Purpose Flour
* 4 Tsp. Sugar
* 2 Tsp. Salt
* 2 1/4 Tsp. Yeast
* 4 Tbs. Butter (I used Salted)
OR 3 Tbs. Lard
** For this recipe I used 3 Tbs. Salted butter and 1 Tbs. Rendered bacon fat
* 1 1/4 Cups Lukewarm water

Step 1: Activate the yeast by combining the following:
* 1 1/4 Cups LukeWarm Water
* 4 Tsp. Sugar
* 2 1/4 Tsp. Yeast
Mix gently and cover for about 10 minutes for the yeast to activate.
** The original recipe calls to mix everything together at once, but I try to activate the yeast ahead of time.

Step 2: Combine the following dry ingredients in a large bowl:
* 4 Cups Unbleached All Purpose Flour
* 2 Tsp. Salt
* Butter or Lard (cut into small pieces, and not cold)
Mix together with a pastry mixer to help incorporate the butter/lard throughout

Step 3: Add the yeast to the dry ingredients
Mix to fold a smooth supple dough

Step 4: Transfer to a lightly greased bowl.
Cover and allow the dough to rise for 30 minutes

Step 5: After 30 minutes, fold the dough onto itself and turn over
Cover and allow to rise for another 30 minutes
** This helps remove excess CO2, and redistributes yeasts food to encourage more growth.

Step 6: Deflate the dough and separate into 6 even sized logs
This is not the final shaping, so it should be rough.

Step 7: Set the rough logs to rest for 15 minutes
Let them rest covered on an un-greased baking sheet.

Step 8: Shape each log into a roll
Should be about 8" long and tapered at the ends

Step 9: Let the rolls rise for 1 hour
Place on a greased baking sheet, and cover

Step 10: Preheat the oven
Set the oven to 375 degrees

Step 11: Prep the rolls for baking
Brush or spray the rolls with water and cut a single long slit down the top from end to end

Bake for 30 minutes, The rolls should be golden brown when done


** I recently made this recipe but forgot to slit the rolls, and I also placed the roughly shaped logs on a greased baking sheet, so the smooth rolls did not keep their shape well. **
