Ingredients:
* 1 Cup Fed Starter
* 1 Cup Unbleached All Purpose Flour
* 8 Tbs. Unsalted Butter (Cold, but not frozen)
** Cut the butter into 1/2" cubes before adding
* 3/4 Tsp. Salt
* 2 Tsp. Baking Powder
* 2/3 Tbs. Cold Milk (Only if needed)

Step 1: Combine the following to start the dough
* 1 Cup Unbleached All Purpose Flour
* 2 Tsp. Baking Powder
* 3/4 Tsp. Salt
Mix

Step 2: Work the butter into the flour
* 8 Tbs. Unsalted Butter (Cold)
Work quickly so the butter does not melt, you want uneven crumbles to form

Step 3: Fold the starter into the dough
* 1 Cup Fed Starter
Mix gently until the dough is cohesive

Step 3.5: If the dough is not moist enough you can add a few Tbs. of cold milk to help it stick
Add the milk little bits at a time and continue mixing

Step 4: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees
Place a rack on the upper 1/3 of the oven

Step 5: Turn out the dough on a floured surface
Gently pat into a disk ~1" thick

Step 6: Cut out individual biscuits
Use a biscuit cutter or a glass, removing the cut biscuits to a greased baking sheet
Re-combine the remaining dough until it has all been made into biscuits

Bake for 20 minutes or until the tops are golden brown

** I want to try adding a little melted butter to the tops before cooking **
