    Traveling to the far side of the world felt like it took longer than “Round the World in 80 Days”:
    As someone who isn’t the biggest fan of flying (apparently wanting to open a window for some fresh air “Isn’t a good idea”), this trip seemed to take longer than the alleged 30 hours my plane ticket says it did. I think during all the date- and time-zone changes, about a week of my life is still unaccounted for. We flew from PIttsburgh to Phoenix, and then to Los Angeles, where we made a stop in the lounge to have a drink and some dinner. Luckily Zannah, my wonderful girlfriend and travel companion on this adventure, had managed to get us upgraded to business class. This was greatly appreciated on the 17 hour flight from LAX to Sydney. The flight was smooth, and being able to lay down certainly made it more comfortable. Nevertheless, I was still very happy when I saw land appear again as we began our descent. We landed in Sydney, I got to cross off another continent from the list of ones I had not yet visited, and the adventure truly began.

  Day 1:
</h2>
<p class="tab">
  We left the airport and hailed a cab to take us to our hotel (it was not until later we learned about the convenient train that could have taken us for far cheaper, and avoided all the traffic). We checked into the hotel and dropped our bags in the room and showered. We wanted to do some exploring in and around Sydney, and replace my carry on bag that had ripped while carrying it through LAX. We grabbed a quick lunch and took a double decker bus North towards Palm Beach and Governor Phillip Park, with the Barrenjoey Lighthouse. We got off the bus near the park, and walked along the beach towards the northern tip of the point, where the lighthouse sat on top of the hill. We hiked up and around, and enjoyed being able to move about after being on a plane for 2 days. We stopped at a small Fish and Chips shop on the way back for some food, and then took a bus to the Manly Wharf, where we took the ferry back to our hotel on Circular Quay. The ferry took us past the Sydney Opera House, and under the Bay Bridge. We made it back and had a quick dinner in the outdoor market at Belles Hot Chicken (it was fantastic) before heading to bed. </p>
