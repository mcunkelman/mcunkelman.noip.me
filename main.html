  Hello there! My name is Matthew but everyone calls me Matt.
  <br>
  This is version 2 of my website. I am sure there will be more.....
  <br>
  I originally built this site while I was laid off,
  <br>
  1. Because I was curious on how a website worked. (Everyone said you had to spend money on it)
  <br>
  2. Because I am stubborn and told people I was going to do it.
  <br>
  3. Because it turns out I can.
  <br>
  <br>
  I still am not completely sure what this site will be. There are several options and things I would like to add. Right now my list of goals (in no particular order are):
  <br>
  1. About me
  <br>
  2. My travel, both where I have been and where I want to go.
  <br>
  3. Cooking recipes and advice, things I have tried and things I am still working on.
  <br>
  4. A PokemonGo database where I can compile and calculate movesets and stats
  <br>
  5. A landing page for financial algorithms. I want to learn more about markets
  <br>
  6. Maybe a few games... why not everyone loves games!
  <br>
  7. I am sure something else will come up.
  <br>
  <br>
  I think the items I have chosen here say a lot about me but I wil add a bit more here. I live with my wonderful girlfriend Zannah and our dog Archer in the house we bought in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh.
  I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from Penn State. I have spent most of my career in the oil and gas industry, but have recently transitioned to something a bit more modern.
  I am currently an Autonomous Systems Engineer for Uber ATG (and I absolutely love it)
  Growing up I hated computers, I could never get them to do what I wanted, or they were just to complex for me to understand what they were doing. I have been working on that, and because of Zan; I have built my own server and use it to host this page.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  There are a lot of things on my mind that I want to accomplish, I am still working on figuring out how to get them all done, but stay tuned. If there is one thing I have leared in my life, its to always bet on myself.
  <br>
  There is a long term plan for this site (well more like an idea of a plan, but for right now I am just putting what I have out there.)

  Former Apple Fan, now I would tell anyone not to buy a Mac. I fell in love with apple because they were simple, were not loaded with bloatware and you had the ability to run windowns on them. They created stable/solid OS's and applications that were user friendly, and enabled you to use your hardware for running tasks, not running the operating system. (Talking about Vista)
  My major complaints recently have been about them refusing to play well with others
    (My iMac is connected to a second Dell monitor and there is no night shift option for the second screen. It doesn't make dell look bad when apple doesn't allow advanced settings for a second screen, everyone knows it dsiplays whatever the computer sends it),
  combined with them refusing to play well with themeslves
    (there are a lot more beautiful photos that I took on my travels that are not displayed on my site because there is a built in incompatability between my iMac hardware and Apple software that literally destroyed photos. Its a known issue and apple keeps pushing garbage updates that make the problem worse),
  in addition to the overall lack of testing/rushed nature of recent OS releases
    (there usde to be a new OS every few years, now its every few months and there are a ton of bugs that go unaddressed for release after release),
  combined with relying on outdated software
    (Everytime apple forces me to do yet another OS update I get the Java JDK error message popping up to tell me that there is something else apple messed up),
  and now apple has become the bloatware
    (They resisted Verizon when they first launched the iPhone but refusing the bloatware, but now every FORCED upgrade {I don't think anyone really considers them upgrades at this point} loads new software I do not want, and changes reducing the intuitive usability of the software I already have).
  We should also talk about have they have taken a page from Microsofts book and now force updates/upgrades on their users, and refuse to let anyone go back, even when their "improvments" directly reduce or destroy specific functions
    (I bought my iMac to be a simple computer that would pull and store pictures from my iPhone, it was sold as a great photo editing computer, and it did that until an update to the "Apple Universe" cause apple components to stop working together, and because Aplle doesn't work well with anyone I was forced to keep using it, even as it corrupted image after image from my travels and left me with no backups).
  I have decided that I will not spend any more money on Apple products, my next phone will not be an iPhone, and my next computer will be windows or Ubuntu. I am just done paying more money to a company that not only stopped caring about its customers, but also stopped caring about its products. Change just for the sake of change is not innovation, it's TRASH.
