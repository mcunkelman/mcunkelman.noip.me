        Hello there! My name is Matthew but everyone calls me Matt.
        <br>
        This is version 3 of my website. I am sure there will be more.....
        <br>
        I originally built this site while I was laid off,
        <br>
        1. Because I was curious on how a website worked. (Everyone said you had to spend money on it)
        <br>
        2. Because I am stubborn and told people I was going to do it.
        <br>
        3. Because it turns out I can.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I think the items I have chosen here say a lot about me but I wil add a bit more here.
        I live with my wonderful girlfriend Zannah and our dog's, Archer and Reka, in the house we bought in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh.
        I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from Penn State.
        I have spent most of my career in the oil and gas industry, but have recently transitioned to something a bit more modern.
        I am currently an Autonomous Systems Engineer for Uber ATG (and I absolutely love it)
        Growing up I hated computers, I could never get them to do what I wanted,
        or they were just to complex for me to understand what they were doing. I have been working on that,
        and because of Zan; I have built my own server and use it to host this page.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        There are a lot of things on my mind that I want to accomplish, I am still working on figuring out how to get them all done, but stay tuned. If there is one thing I have leared in my life, its to always bet on myself.
        <br>
        There is a long term plan for this site (well more like an idea of a plan, but for right now I am just putting what I have out there.)
