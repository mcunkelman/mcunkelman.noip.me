Flew from Pittsburgh to Jackson via Denver (instead of Chicago as planned)
Got in around 8pm and were a little hungry and tired

Woke up in the AirBnB and had coffee and spent some time going over the travel plans.
Headed to the St Anthony Sand Dunes after breakfast, to do some light hiking in the sand. It was a pretty cool place, and a very unique experience.
From there we began the drive towards Mammoth Hot Springs at the Northern end of Yellowstone, while eating our packed lunches in the car.
We drove through Caribou-Targhee National Forest, and stopped in Island Park to see the moose along the river.
We entered the park through the Western Entrance and turned North on the Grand Loop Rd.
It was a spectacular drive, and we stopped several times to have a look around.
We stopped at Swan Lake, the Golden Gate, and for some construction on the way through the park.
We wanted to stop and the obsidian cliff, but were not able to because of the construction.
We also saw some Sandhill Cranes (They are huge) while we were driving.
On the way back we stopped at the Roaring Mt, Swan Lake (again), Beryl Springs (the hottest in the park)
We ate at the Otter Creek Pub (elk burger) in West Yellowstone.

We woke up a bit earlier and had a quick breakfast so we could be on the road by 8:30
We went back in through the Western Gate and headed towards the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone
We hiked the Southern Rim Trail to see the Upper and Lower falls
After we finished the hike we headed towards Yellowstone lake and the Lake Yellowstone Hotel for lunch.
We had a delicious lunch (bison burger) and then took a quick nap on some very comfortable couches in the lobby.
Then we headed to the general store to get some huckleberry ice cream sandwiches (they were delicious)
We then headed south around the west side of the lake to the west thumb basin to see the mud pots and hot springs.
By then it was after 5pm and was time to head back through Hayden Valley to look for Wolves
We saw a lot of bison, some were very close to the car (Brent almost had one walk into him from behind)
At one overlook we stopped where we saw a lot of other people were also stopped and heard people saying that a wolf had been spotted, but when I got up to where they were they said I had just missed a black wolf.
We hung around and took some more pictures for a while before continuing up the road
At the next pull off spot I saw the person who had said we just missed the wolf stopped again, we (Liz) decided to stop and we got out and started looking around. After a few minutes I saw a large dark shape moving in the distance. I assumed it was another bison as the heard was sprawled all around us, but this one wasn’t moving like the others. It took a second to register that this wasn’t a bison, but the black wolf. Seeing it was a real treat. We stayed and watched it for a few minutes as it came into and out of view behind the rolling landscape. We then decided to continue on since it was 8pm
We arrived back at the AirBnB around 10:30 pm and quickly packed some things up, since tomorrow we change AirBnbs.

2019.08.01

We were up and packed, to switch AirBnB’s
We headed back in through the western gate for the last time
We turned south around the lake towards the Grand Prismatic Spring, but we went to Fairy Falls with a beautiful overlook of the Spring
We then headed up to the falls where we had a nice lunch, and were only bothered by the little chipmunks that were begging for our food
We hastened our hike back a little since the sky was threatening rain
We then made our way to the General Store at Old Faithful for some more huckleberry ice cream bars and some other small souvenirs
From there we continued South, out through the Southern Entrance to the park, and into Grand Teton Park
We stopped at the Flagg Ranch to see one of the places where Lily was staying for the summer
Then we went to the Jackson Lake Lodge to have a small snack and some delicious drinks
While at drinks we saw a herd of elk in the distance and decided to get a closer look, so we stopped along the Jackson Lake Dam.
We couldn’t see the elk, but did catch a glimpse of a peregrine falcon and a golden eagle soaring overhead
Saw the elk along the road and a runner running straight towards it that we didn't warn.
We made our way further south, and stopped at a lot of pull-offs to see more animals. We saw pronghorn antelope, elk, bison, mule deer, and maybe moose (unconfirmed sighting)
We then headed into Jackson and had dinner at Thai Me Up and it was fantastic
From there we headed to the AirBnB, but got stuck in traffic behind a huge mudslide that delayed us by more than 45 minutes
We arrived at the AirBnB in Alpine Wyoming and it is a cool log lodge.

2019.08.02

Met the owner and her dogs Butch (lab hound mix) and Zeek (Newfoundland)
Started laundry
Went into Jackson to meet up with Lilly
We decided to slightly change our plans since there was still fog in the mountains, we decided to go hiking around Leigh Lake first and then do the Aerial Tram
We drove back up through Grand Teton Park on a windy dirt road along the mountains.
It took us a while to find parking, and we were a little time constrained when we set off.
We made it past string lake and over to Leigh Lake, and Brent and I put our feet in, while Lilly went swimming
We then headed back down into the village of teton for the Aerial Tram
I was a little nervous since I have had issues with heights before, and the tram climbs over 4000’ in elevation to the top of Rendezvous Mountain (10,449’ elevation)
But the only time I felt anything was as we came across the first precipice and unexpectedly there were more massive cliff faces to go over
But the view was too spectacular to look away
At the top we had waffles (no idea why these were there but they were good!) and then did some hiking
Managed to find a glacier/snowpack to take pictures with
Took the tram back down into Teton Village
We met Charlie at Snake River Brewing for drinks and dinner
We then headed back to the AirBnB (no mudslides this time), Charlie went back to Bondurant for small mammal trapping in the morning
We hung out for a while and chatted before heading to bed

Woke up and headed into town to Persephone for breakfast, it was delicious
Then we walked around the farmers market for a while and some of the other stores around the Jackson Town Square
We also walked over to see the vertical gardens
We met up with Charlie again, and then he and Lily went to get the kayak they brought registered to use in Grand Teton Park, and we went to pick up the other boats we had reserved.
We took all the boats to String Lake where we put in and paddled up to Leigh Lake where we had a short portage
We paddled around Leigh Lake until we found a nice beach where we stopped and hung out for a while
We then raced back across the lake (Brent and I lost to Zannah and Lilly, and we are gracious losers)
When we got back to the pull out we found Liz and heard that she had had a bear encounter while we were gone.
She had some really good pictures of a mom and 2 cubs
After kayaking Lily and Charlie decided to go for a run, while the rest of us headed back towards the AirBnB.
On the way back we stopped to get some ground Bison and other ingredients to make dinner that night
We also stopped at Melvin Brewing Company which is right across the lake from our AirBnB to have some beer and a snack
We sat outside and chatted with some people and met their Portugese Water Dog puppy, until we could hear thunder and see rain coming in, so we headed out
We got back to the AirBnB and decided to wait to see what the weather would do, but it seemed to miss us so I was put on grilling duty
We grilled onions, potatoes, zucchini, peppers, bread, salmon, and bison sliders
While we were grilling, we also were tasting different beers and having bourbon drinks with muddled berries from the farmers market (red raspberries, golden raspberries, and royal raspberries) and orange slices
Dinner ended up being served at about quarter until 10 and it was delicious
After dinner we played Shang Hai and chatted and hung out until everyone was tired and went to bed

Woke up and had breakfast
Went the the Jackson Fork Ranch (in Bondurant, WY) where Lily and Charlie had been staying to get a tour. It’s a massive place and we met the ranch dog Maverick who was so excited to see us.
We took a walking tour of the horse barn and some of the guest houses and around the owners mansion. The owner is the one who funds the research that Lily and Charlie are doing (He founded TD Ameritrade and now owns the Chicago Cubs). We also got to see some of his white cow/bison hybrids
From there we went into Bridger-Teton National Forest to see where the previous fall’s wildfires had burned
We went back to the ranch and had a picnic lunch before deciding to go explore for some hot springs
Lily had heard of some undeveloped hot springs existing near Granite Hot Springs, so off we went! On the way, we stopped by a spectacular waterfall and Lily and I climbed to the top while Brent and Liz put their feet in downstream. From the top, we realized we could see the hot spring. Brent, Lily, and I went in to the hot spring (along with about 8 people and 3 dogs, it was very crowded) while Zan and Liz slowly made their way to the car.
On our way into Jackson we started seeing smoke just over the nearest ridge but weren't sure what was going on until we got an emergency alert for a wildfire.
The fire had started just outside of town and had been caused by a lightning strike.
We went to The Roadhouse in Jackson for a beer and an appetizer, I had the Walrus and it was fantastic.
We then went to Hatch Taqueria for dinner, which was also really good. (Except for Zan being seated under the gap in the awning so she got a little wet.) This was also when I learned to question any time Lily innocently asks me to try something. I experienced the hottest salsa I’ve ever had in my life.
After dinner we went back to the AirBnB and began packing up to head home the following morning

Woke up and loaded the car to head to the airport
Passed the area that had burned the day before, it was weird seeing the blackened hillside
Got to the airport and through security
Had a longer than planned layover in Chicago. Went to Fronterra for lunch - delicious.
Had a slightly longer delay due to poop disaster on the plane as we were waiting to board (Someone from the previous flight had tried to stuff something down the toilet in the bathroom, and the mechanic had to come and remove it.)
Finally made it home after 1AM to see my puppy!!!
